# Honeypot Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary tools, scripts, and documentation to perform honeypot analysis. Honeypots are decoy systems or network resources designed to lure potential attackers and study their behavior. This analysis aims to gain valuable insights into various types of cyber threats, attack patterns, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Introduction

Honeypot analysis is an essential component of any cybersecurity research and defense strategy. By deploying honeypots within a network or on the internet, security researchers can capture valuable data about cyber threats, attacker techniques, and potential vulnerabilities in systems or applications.

This repository provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up different types of honeypots and analyze the collected data. Additionally, it includes tools to visualize the data for better understanding and create comprehensive reports.

## Setting Up Honeypots

In this section, we provide detailed instructions on setting up various honeypots. Each honeypot type may have its specific setup requirements, configurations, and considerations. You can find subdirectories within the `honeypots/` folder, each dedicated to a particular honeypot type.

- [honeypots/snort](honeypots/snort): Instructions and configurations for setting up a Snort-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) honeypot.
- [honeypots/dionaea](honeypots/dionaea): Guide for deploying the Dionaea honeypot, which emulates vulnerable services to capture malware samples and collect attack data.
- [honeypots/cowrie](honeypots/cowrie): Instructions for installing and configuring Cowrie, a popular SSH/Telnet honeypot that logs attackers' actions.

## Data Collection

This section covers the process of collecting data generated by the honeypots. It includes details on data storage, log formats, and any additional tools used to enhance data collection efficiency.

## Data Analysis

Once the data has been collected, it's time to analyze it. This section provides guidelines on how to process and interpret the data. It may include scripts, tools, or Jupyter notebooks to aid in the analysis process.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding the honeypot data effectively. This section contains code and instructions for creating informative graphs, charts, and dashboards that present the analysis results visually.

## Reporting

Reporting is essential for sharing the findings of the honeypot analysis with the broader community or stakeholders. In this section, you'll find templates and guidelines for creating comprehensive reports.
